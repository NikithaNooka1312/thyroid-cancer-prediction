## 📌 Project Summary

- 🔍 Cleaned and processed a synthetic clinical dataset for thyroid cancer detection and staging.  
- 🧪 Handled categorical symptoms and lab results including TSH, Free T4, Thyroglobulin, and Calcium.  
- ⚖️ Ensured balanced class distribution for accurate classification.  
- 🌲 Built and fine-tuned machine learning models (Random Forest) for both cancer detection and stage prediction.  
- 📊 Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.  
- 🔍 Applied SHAP to interpret feature contributions to model predictions.  
- 💾 Saved trained models for deployment using Pickle.
